However, it remains unclear if the tumor-specific lipid changes can be detected at the level of systemic lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to perform comprehensive analysis of lipids in breast cancer patient serum samples. Lipidomic profiling using an established analytical platform was performed in two cohorts of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The analyses were performed for 142 patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the results before chemotherapy were validated in an independent cohort of 194 patients. The analyses revealed that in general the tumor characteristics are not reflected in the serum samples. However, there was an association of specific triacylglycerols (TGs) in patients' response to chemotherapy. These TGs containing mainly oleic acid (C18:1) were found in lower levels in those patients showing pathologic complete response before receiving chemotherapy. Some of these TGs were also associated with estrogen receptor status and overall or disease-free survival of the patients. The results suggest that the altered serum levels of oleic acid in breast cancer patients are associated with their response to chemotherapy."									Study Submission Date	12/06/14									Study Public Release Date	17/06/14									Study File Name	s_BreastCancerLipidome.txt									STUDY DESIGN DESCRIPTORS										Study Design Type	intervention design	repeated measure design								Study Design Type Term Accession Number										Study Design Type Term Source REF										Comment[Keywords]	serum	lipidomics	breast cancer	Chemotherapy						Comment[Keywords Term Accession Number]	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BTO_0001239		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_1612	http://www.ifomis.org/acgt/1.0#Chemotherapy						Comment[Keywords Term Source REF]	BTO		BAO	ACGT-MO						Comment[number of study groups]	2									Comment[number of subjects per study group]	142;194									STUDY PUBLICATIONS										Study PubMed ID	24114462									Study Publication DOI	10.1002/ijc.28491									Study Publication Author List	"Hilvo M, Gade S, Hy•À_tyl•À_inen T, Nekljudova V, Sepp•À_nen-Laakso T, Sysi-Aho M, Untch M, Huober J, von Minckwitz G, Denkert C, Ore•À_i?

The patients were randomized into three arms: 4ÌÑ epirubicine, cyclophosphamide (EC) ‰ Õ docetaxel (D) vs. 4ÌÑ EC ‰ Õ 4ÌÑ D/capecitabine (C) vs. 4ÌÑ EC ‰ Õ 4ÌÑ D ‰ Õ 4ÌÑ C (Fig. 1). In addition, all HER2-positive patients (according to local pathology) received trastuzumab. Eligibility criteria and details of the trial have been described previously. The protocol was reviewed by all responsible local ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from the patients. One of the secondary endpoints of the trial was the investigation of biomarkers capable of predicting therapy response. Tissue, blood and serum were collected at baseline (BL) as well as at the time of surgery (OP). In our study, we used two cohorts of nonfasting serum samples. The global lipidomic analysis was performed for the discovery cohort comprising 142 BL and 111 OP samples, and an additional cohort of 194 BL samples was used for the validation (Supporting Information Table 1). The blood samples were collected during several years, centrifuged immediately and stored at ‰öÕ20å¡C at the site for no longer than month. After that the serum samples were centrally stored at ‰öÕ80å¡C until used for the analyses."	"Ten microliters of serum was extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1; 100 åµl) after adding an internal standard mixture with PC(17:0/0:0), Cer(d18:1/17:0), PC(17:0/17:0), PE(17:0/17:0) and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0) at a concentration level of 0.2 åµg per sample. The samples were vortexed for 2 min, incubated for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 7,800g for 3 min. A labeled lipid standard mixture containing PC(16:1-D3/0:0), PC(16:1/16:1-D6) and TG(16:0/16:0/16:0‰ÛÒ13C3) at a concentration level of 0.1 åµg per sample was added into the separated lipid extracts (100 åµl) before UPLC-MS analysis."	"Lipid extracts were analyzed on a Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM (UPLC‰ã¢). The column (at 50å¡C) was an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 2.1 mm ÌÑ 100 mm with 1.7-ë_m particles. The solvent system was (A) ultrapure water (1% 1 M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and (B) LC/MS-grade acetonitrile/isopropanol (1:1, 1% 1M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and the gradient started from 65% A/35% B, reached 80% B in 2 min, 100% B in 7 min and remained there for 7 min. The flow rate was 0.400 ml/min and 2 åµl aliquot was injected (Acquity Sample Organizer, at 10å¡C)."	"Lipid extracts were analyzed on a Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM (UPLC‰ã¢). Reserpine was used as the lock spray reference compound. The data were collected at mass range of m/z 200‰ÛÒ1,200 with scan duration of 0.2 sec in positive ion mode."		The data were processed using MZmine 2 software and the lipid identifications were based on an internal spectral library. The lipidomic data used for statistical analyses were expressed as åµmol/l.				Study Protocol URI										Study Protocol Version										Study Protocol Parameters Name		Post Extraction;Derivatization	Chromatography Instrument;Column type;Column model	Scan polarity;Scan m/z range;Instrument;Mass analyzer;Ion source						Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Accession Number		;	;;	;;;;						Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Source REF		;	;;	;;;;						Study Protocol Components Name										Study Protocol Components Type										Study Protocol Components Type Term Accession Number										Study Protocol Components Type Term Source REF										STUDY CONTACTS										Study Person Last Name	Hilvo									Study Person First Name	Mika									Study Person Mid Initials										Study Person Email	mika.hilvo@vtt.fi									Study Person Phone	-5347474									Study Person Fax										Study Person Address	"Tietotie 2, 02044 VTT, Espoo, Finland"									Study Person Affiliation	VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland									Study Person Roles										Study Person Roles Term Accession Number										Study Person Roles Term Source REF
